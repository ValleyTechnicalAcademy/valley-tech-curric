## Learning to Code Requires Two Things:

1. Understanding that this can be incredibly difficult and frustrating
2. Maintaining the self-confidence necessary to believe that YOU can do this

## Getting “stuck” when coding is still progress

“You cannot tell whether you’re learning something when you’re learning it—in fact, learning feels a lot more like frustration.”

“What I’ve learned is that this period of frustration is actually when people improve the most, and these improvements are usually obvious to an outsider. If you feel frustrated while trying to understand new concepts, try to remember that it might not feel like it, but you’re probably rapidly expanding your knowledge.”
